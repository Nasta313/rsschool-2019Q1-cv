        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>I studied web design at BSU for the last two years. While studying I realized that I would like to deal with Frontend development. 
        This is exactly what I want to do and it gives me pleasure. I graduated from the University in November 2018. And now I continue study something new in 
        this direction everyday.
        I am extremely motivated for getting my first job in IT sphere. I can describe myself as fast learner, hard worker and team player,
        highly organized and detail-oriented.</p>
